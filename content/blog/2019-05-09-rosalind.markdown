We recently bade a fond farewell to two [of][db] [the][orta] champions of our ‚Äúopen source by default‚Äù ethos, but
this spirit lives on at Artsy.

Today we open-source one of our key metadata apps, and explain how it fits into Artsy‚Äôs ecosystem.

## Open source by default‚Ä¶ or at least eventually

Even when we don‚Äôt start a project by building in the open, we encourage ourselves to question why that is so. Can
we go ahead and open things up? If the answer is no (and it might be), are we clear on why not?

We‚Äôve even added a [light bit of process][peril] to promote this kind of questioning. Our robots will periodically
trawl our GitHub org and file an issue against any closed-source repo that doesn‚Äôt include a rationale for its
closed nature in the project README.

One of our repos got this [treatment][issue] recently. I‚Äôm the point person on this project, and while I considered
adding a rationale of ‚Äú_primary author will die of acute impostor syndrome if this repo is open-sourced, he will
just stop living_ üòÖ,‚Äù instead we‚Äôve gone ahead and made this repo public.

Meet [Rosalind][rosalind], an admin app for large-batch genoming operations on Artsy‚Äôs database of artworks.

## The Art Genome Project, and the Genome Team

Rosalind is a close cousin of [Helix][helix], our original dedicated genoming app. (That project is private for
now, but was described by [Sarah][sarah] in an an [earlier blog post][helix_post].)

What‚Äôs genoming, you ask, and what‚Äôs it got to do with art?

Artsy‚Äôs discovery and recommendation capabilites are powered in large part by [The Art Genome Project][tagp_about],
a comprehensive system of classification that uses our homegrown art-historical controlled vocabulary to describe
the artists and artworks in our database. (Here‚Äôs an [explainer][tagp_facts] and our full list of
[categories][tagp_categories]. You can even view a [structured data export][tagp_export] of the ‚Äúgenes‚Äù which make
up our controlled vocabulary.)

For a long time, our team of art historians ‚Äî the Genome Team ‚Äî bore sole responsibility for applying this
vocabulary, using Helix, to the artworks that entered our platform. This was always a daunting task, and only
became more so as our network of partner galleries and institutions continued to grow and upload more artworks.

Artsy is now home to over 1,000,000 artworks by over 100,000 artists, described by over 1,000 genes. A few years
ago, it became clear to us that in order to continue applying high-quality metadata at scale, we were going to need
some new processes and some new tools.

On the process side, we decided to share a simplified genoming interface with our gallery partners, so that they
could start contributing the metadata that would be most relevant to our audience of collectors. We called it
‚ÄúPartner Applied Categories.‚Äù

<figure class="illustration">

</figure>

Note that this is a tiny subset of our full genome vocabulary, and that values are applied as on/off, versus the
more nuanced 0-100 score that our own Genome Team would apply.

This was a good step, a fundamental building block in scaling artwork metadata on our platform, but it created new
problems as well as new opportunities.

This is where Rosalind came in.

## About Rosalind

We started work on this tool in earnest in early 2017, at a time when we felt an internal need for the ability to,
among other things:

- Perform boolean searches against our database of artworks using The Art Genome Project‚Äôs vocabulary ‚Äì a general
  purpose superpower that would be useful for our art historians, our editorial team, and our collector relations
  and marketing teams, among others

- Make large-batch modifications to artworks‚Äô genomes (whether genomed by us, or by our gallery partners via
  Partner Applied Categories), in order to maintain metadata quality

The user experience we built looks something like this:

Under the hood this is a Rails 5 application that talks to our core API server and our Elasticsearch cluster on the
backend, and serves up a React single page app on the frontend.

</figure>

Among the tactical goals of this project were to support heavy-duty admin workflows by:

- offering a featureful interface tailored to power users
- adding a useful complement of keyboard navigation capabilities
- making it as blazingly fast as possible

That last goal led to the somewhat quirky decision to have Rosalind talk to the Elasticsearch cluster directly,
instead of making a search request to our core API server.

While this entails some risk of drift from our accumulated search best practices as encapsulated in our API, in
reality this has not been a problem yet. Rosalind‚Äôs search needs are fairly straightforward and using
Elasticsearch‚Äôs REST API has been working out just fine. And it is fast as heck.

Although the project was mostly built out in early 2017, we‚Äôve periodically revisited it for upkeep and
maintenance. Along the way we‚Äôve ridden some of the larger trends in the React+Rails ecosystem, as well as internal
trends.

- We started out on [webpack-rails][webpack_rails], an early pioneer in nudging Rails away from the Asset Pipeline
  provided by Sprockets, and toward Webpack

- We [migrated][webpacker_migration] over to the [Webpacker][webpacker] gem once that became a core Rails concern

- We [migrated][tests_migration] from RSpec feature specs to [Rails system tests][system_tests], after that was
  rolled out

- We experimented with adopting [Reaction][reaction], our shared internal React component library

- We more recently switched to using [Palette][palette], our nascent design system library

After being in maintenance mode for a couple of years, we‚Äôre excited to start up new feature work again, and plan
to bring even more bits of the [Artsy Omakase][artsy_omakase] into this project. Maybe this project will even be a
good proving ground for [prettier-ruby][prettier_ruby].

Whatever happens, Rosalind will continue to play an important role in maintaining Artsy‚Äôs high-quality metadata and
in making Artsy the best online destination for art.
